# caesar-cipher-python
This project is a console-based Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool developed in Python. It allows users to encode or decode messages using a fixed shift number, a classic encryption method. Users can choose to work with messages entered directly in the console or load them from a text file. 

Features
- Encrypt or decrypt messages using a user-defined shift key.
- Read messages from user input or from a file.
- Save output to a file (`results.txt`) when using file input.
- Input validation for mode selection, shift values, and filenames.
- Clear, modular structure with reusable functions.
